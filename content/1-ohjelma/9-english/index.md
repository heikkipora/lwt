***Welcome to the most attractive coastal town in Finland, experince the charming old houses and beautiful gardens and enjoy the unique atmosphere during the Historical Houses of Loviisa-event.***

**Welcome to Loviisa**

The city of Loviisa was founded in 1745. It's named after Lovisa Ulrika, the Swedish Queen consort of Adolf Frederick of Sweden. Loviisa is a small town by the sea, located about 87 km east of Helsinki on the way to St. Petersburg. The sea stretches all the way to the town centre.

The old town in Lovisa survived from the great fire of 1855 and is today one of the most well-preserved wooden towns in Finland. Narrow sandstone and cobblestone streets and small wooden houses provide fashionable sights for visitors.
